blurb: Seasoned Programmer and Manager

  I am an experienced programmer with over 30 years of experience in software engineering and 
  management.  My strengths are building distributed systems in Java and Python.  I have a swath of 
  experience in various database systems (DynamoDB, postgres, MongoDB, SQL Server, etc) and eventing 
  and streaming services (EventBridge, SQS, Kenesis, Kafka).  I have a decent familiarity with 
  front-end (primarily React and Svelte) and mobile frameworks as well.
