# Andrew's Resume

This is my resume generator.  I update `resume.yml` and github actions runs the python script which generates a PDF resume similar in style to Google Doc's default resume template.

My most current resume can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://github.com/aviolette/resume/releases/latest) and downloading AJVResume.pdf.
